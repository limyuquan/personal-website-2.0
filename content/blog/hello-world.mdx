Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my personal website, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Why I Started This Blog

Throughout my journey journey in University, doing software engineering internships and school at the same time, I feel that I have a lot of thoughts regarding software.
I love shipping code, building features, and I would love to have a platform to share my personal journey and experience.

However, I find that sharing it on platforms like LinkedIn and other blog pages is a little too public for me, so this will be a more intimate look into my thoughts as a software engineer and as a student.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Technical tutorials**: Deep dives into technologies I work with like React, Next.js, Python, and Go
- **Project showcases**: Behind-the-scenes looks at projects I'm building
- **Career insights**: Lessons learned from my experiences in the tech industry
- **Random thoughts**: Occasionally, just interesting things I find worth sharing, that may or may not be useful to you


If you find the topics I write interesting, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn and we can have a conversation!
